Due to the nature of the situation, we have decided to cancel all in-person events for the remainder of 2020, as well as our in-person [Divacups & Lunapads office hours](/portfolio/divacup/). We are trying to restock resources as often as we can, but we anticipate being unable to do so on a regular basis. 

#### The space is now open for use. 2 people are allowed in the space at a time.

##### PLEASE DO NOT ENTER IF YOU: Have a fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, or shortness of breath and/or are a close contact of a person who tested positive for COVID-19. All other visitors, please wash your hands, or clean them with hand sanitizer before and after your visit.

### Masks are mandatory. 
### Please practice physical distancing.

We have members who are/live with folks that are immunocompromised, young, elderly, and with pre-existing health conditions. This greatly informs out decision, as well as our priority to maintain the health and safety of our community. 

We apologize for the inconvenience that this can cause our folks who share the space and rely on our resources. During this time of uncertainty, we thank you for your understanding and cooperations and will keep you informed if anything changes. 

Take care, \
UBC Womenâ€™s Centre \
