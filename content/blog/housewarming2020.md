## JOIN US ONLINE MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28TH FOR SOCIALIZING, GAMES, CRAFTS, AND MORE!!

Join us for a celebration to kick off the first semester ♥ This community-building event is a great opportunity to learn about the space, meet new friends, and find ways to get involved with the Centre!! Help us make radical art that can be put up and featured in the space once the centre opens again - part of our tradition of using art as a form of resistance and healing. Most importantly, join us on zoom to meet our community members and make new friends, in addition to finding ways to get involved with our activism!

The UBC Women's Centre organizes on the traditional, unceded, ancestral, and unceded lands of the xʷməθkʷəy̓ əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Tsleil-Waututh Nations. We recognize our complicity in the settler colonial project as a majority non-Indigenous group of students, and strive to organize in a way that honours this and upholds the sovereignty of all Indigenous peoples.

We also acknowledge that acts of systemic colonization against Indigenous folks are currently taking place in an ongoing manner within institutions, power structures and language use. This includes the enforcement of a colonial gender binary, and the ways in which this has affected Indigenous peoples and lands. We must partake in recognizing our positions and complicity in settler colonialism on these stolen ancestral lands and work towards returning these lands back to the sovereign nations of Turtle Island.

We welcome ALL community members facing gender-based oppression.

Additionally, we also acknowledge that there is no singular definition to womanhood. That indeed, part of the colonial project was and is instilling a colonial gender binary onto Indigenous bodies. As such, the Women's Centre exists to support anyone facing gender-based oppression and welcomes all women (trans and cis), as well as non-binary and Two-Spirit folks to use the space and get involved.


This is a safe space for you :)
