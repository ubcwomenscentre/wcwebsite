Join us for a celebration to kick off the first online-semester on September 28th from 6pm to 8pm Vancouver time. This community-building event is a great opportunity to learn about the space, meet new friends, play games,and find ways to get involved with the Centre. Help us make radical art that can be put up and featured in the space once the centre opens again, which part of our tradition of using art as a form of resistance and healing. Most importantly, join us on zoom to meet our community members and make new friends, in addition to finding ways to get involved with our activism. This event will be through zoom, if you have any accessibility concerns or other questions, please email us at ubcwomenscentre@gmail.com.
